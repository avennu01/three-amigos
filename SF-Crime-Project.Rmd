This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("readr")

dat_crime <- read_csv("/Users/abhiplayground/Desktop/train.csv")

table(dat_crime$Category)

dat_crimeNew <- dat_crime %>% separate(col = Dates, into = c("Date","Time"), sep = " ",fill = "right" ) %>% filter(!Category %in% c("BAD CHECKS","BRIBERY","FORGERY/COUNTERFEITING","FRAUD","GAMBLING","LIQUOR LAWS","PORNOGRAPHY/OBSCENE MAT","PROSTITUTION","SUICIDE","TREA","FAMILY OFFENSES"))

View(table(dat_crime %>% filter(Category == "FAMILY OFFENSES") %>% select(Descript)))

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
