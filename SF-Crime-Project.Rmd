This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("readr")

## dat_crime <- read.csv(unz("https://github.com/avennu01/three-amigos/blob/master/train.csv.zip","train.csv")) .. unable to direclty read data from GitHub

dat_crime <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/kjkt5ndf3jkibq4/train.csv?raw=1")

table(dat_crime$Category)

# seperating Dates in to Date & Time and selecting below categories only, rest have been eliminated based on group consensus since they dint have impact on our end objective

# Missing Person .. Need more deepdive 

dat_crimeNew <- dat_crime %>% separate(col = Dates, into = c("Date","Time"), sep = " ",fill = "right" ) %>% filter(Category %in% c("ASSAULT","DISORDERLY CONDUCT","DRUNKENNESS","DRUG/NARCOTIC","KIDNAPPING","LARCENY/THEFT","LOITERING","NON-CRIMINAL","ROBBERY","SECONDARY CODES","SEX OFFENSES FORCIBLE","SEX OFFENSES NON FORCIBLE","STOLEN PROPERTY","SUSPICIOUS OCC","VANDALISM","VEHICLE THEFT"))

dat_occ <- dat_crimeNew %>% group_by(Descript) %>% summarize(occurence= n())
