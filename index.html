<a id="background-and-motivation" class="anchor" href="#background-and-motivation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Background and Motivation</strong>:</h1>

 <p>Our project motivation was to analyze data that was easy to relate to.</p>
 
  <P> Here starts the journey of three amigos, with the accomodation set at St.Regis each of them had they own favourite destiantion in mind for a quick jog 
  but would only do so if other two are also intrested in the same spot. Hmm ... conflict of intrest and also how would one convince other or both to agree 
  with one's choice. They started flipping coins and rolling dice but none would give them the answer they seek, comes data analytics to the rescue. </P>
  
  <p> With SFO crime data readily available,we wanted to see if we can identify some relationships with likely variables and come up with practical recommendations 
  which route would be the safest.</p>


<h1>
<a id="project-objectives" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Project Objectives</strong>:</h1>

<p>Analyze the San Francisco Crime data set provide by Kaggle.com to predict the likelihood of certain crime occurances
  and severities based upon popular travel routes and suggesting a better path.</p> 


<h1>
<a id="approach" class="anchor" href="#approach" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Approach</strong>:</h1>

<p>Examine SFO Crime dataset,wrangle data to a level where its only relevant to our end objective i.e., to tidy and 
  collect observations which affect our mode of transportation which is WALKING. Wrangle it, Analyze it and finally Visualize it 
  to determine relationship between variables (if any) and conclude our objective by defining 1-3 walking paths by overlay statistical
  likelihood of crime occurrences and suggesting better path. We intend to use the ‘training’ data set, as it is the only 
  full-featured data set.</p>

<a id="analysis" class="anchor" href="#analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Analysis</strong>:</h1>

 <ul>
 <li>Data Wrangling : <p> We started working with the SFO Crime train dataset readily available, initial challenge was to 
  identify the categories which are related to our end objective. Provided dataset had multiple categories labled as "Category"
  and each category was further subdivided in to multiple sub-categories here labled as "Descript" based on the act commited.
  There were few "Category"s and their "Descript"s which were outright not relevent to our cause and hence were filtered out 
  to mention few "BAD CHECKS", "GAMBLING" etc., </p>
   <p>Our second phase of wrangling,was to closely examine "Descript"s and to filter out any non-relevant descriptions from 
  Category, for example "ASSAULT" category though is relevant to our case, act's such as "inflict injury on cohabitee",
  "threatening phone calls","battery during labour dispute" and similar others are not relevant to a person whose 
  mode of tranportation is WALKING from point A to point B. 
 </p> </li>
 
 <li>Visualization :
 <p> The map below plots the wrangled data showing all categories of crime. As you can see, there is a clear
  concentration near the northeastern section of the city. This map provided us with the guidance on which areas 
  we needed to concentrate for further analysis and where to plot our routes.</p>
                     <p>For reference, we’ve provided zip code boundaries as overlay.</p>

   <p> Below map provides crime density views of the following class of crimes: Property, Life and Nuisance. 
   Life related crimes such as assault, kidnapping, missing persons, and sex offenses have a much wider footprint 
   mainly due to the number and prevalence of assault related crimes. Whereas nuisance related crimes such as 
   disorderly conduct, drug/narcotic, drunkenness, and non-criminal are very much concentrated in one region.</p>
  <img src="images/pic2.PNG">
  
  <p> Per the histogram below, larceny and theft crime top the chart at above 70,000 occurrences, followed by 
  assault and other suspicious activities.</p>

  <p> Below we have tried to point out few interesting trends of crime by class,district and day. Not only does the southern 
  district have the largest   number of crimes, it has significantly higher property related crimes. Since southern district 
  has some interesting trends   we decided to delve into this district a bit further.  </p>
                     <p>Daily Average Crime by class for Southern DistrictOn Average, on Fridays, in the southern district, 
  there are  little under 6000 crimes. Approximately 60% are related to property, 10% to nuisance and 30% to life related crimes.
  The second highest daily crime rate falls on Saturday followed by, surprisingly, Wednesday!</p>
    <img src="images/pic4.PNG">
  
  <p>The chart below shows the frequencies of crime within a given hour for the Southern District. We found it interesting that the 
  highest occurrences fall in the afternoon between noon and 5 pm with the peak between 3-4pm. The lowest occurrence 
  is in the early morning hours between 4-5 am.</p>
