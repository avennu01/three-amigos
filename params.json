With SFO crime data so readily available, we wanted to see if we can identify some relationships with likely variables and come up with practical recommendations on likelihood of encountering a particular crime on a particular walking path.\r\n\r\n# **Project Objectives**: \r\n           Analyze the San Francisco Crime data set provide by Kaggle.com to predict the likelihood of certain crime occurances and severities based upon popular travel routes and suggesting a better path. \r\n\r\n# **Approach**:\r\n           Examine SFO Crime dataset,wrangle data to a level where its only relevant to our end objective i.e., to tidy and collect observations which affect our mode of transportation which is WALKING. Wrangle it, Analyze it and finally Visualize it to determine relationship between variables (if any) and conclude our objective by defining 1-3 walking paths by overlay statistical likelihood of crime occurrences and suggesting better path. We intend to use the ‘training’ data set, as it is the only full-featured data set.  \r\n\r\n# **Analysis**:\r\n          ## Data Wrangling \r\n          ## Proximity Algorithm \r\n          ## Visualization \r\n",
